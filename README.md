# Preference-modeling-with-TOPSIS-using-N-ary-norm-operators
 In this release one can find matlab codes for n-ary TOPSIS
 that uses n-ary norm operators to set preference for either positive
 ideal solution or negative ideal solution depending on the practical
 problem. Basic TOPSIS has been critized about not being able to set
 preference for either positive ideal solution or negative ideal solution
 and it is considering them to be equally important. With n-ary norm operator
 we can prefer one over another depending on the practical problem. 
 Preference can be modelled by imposing stricter or weaker norm operator 
 depending on practical problem. Another generalization in the code is that
 instead of using Euclidean distance code is generalized to Minkowski distance.
